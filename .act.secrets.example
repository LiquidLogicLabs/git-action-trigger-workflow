# Act Secrets for gitea-action-trigger-workflow
# These secrets are used when running act locally
#
# Note: If you have secrets configured in ~/.actrc, you can leave these commented
# and act will use the values from ~/.actrc instead
#
# Copy this file to .act.secrets and uncomment/modify values as needed:
# - Remove the # at the beginning of the line
# - Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens
#
# WARNING: Never commit .act.secrets to git! It's already in .gitignore
